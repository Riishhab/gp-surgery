              A doctor (also known as a GP or General Practitioner), is the type
              of doctor you will see for general health problems.
            </p>

            <p>
              We recommend that you register with a GP as soon as possible after
              you arrive.
            </p>

            <p>
              An appointment with an NHS (National Health Service) GP is free.

                If you were getting treatment for a condition that you need more
                treatment for, it is important that you register with a doctor
                as soon as you can, to make sure your condition is managed
                safely.

              GP surgeries are the first place you can contact if you have a
              health problem. They can treat many illnesses, give health advice,
              and prescribe medicine. They can also refer you to other NHS
              services.
            </p>

            <p>Everyone can register with a GP and you do not need:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>proof of address</li>
              <li>immigration status</li>
              <li>ID</li>
              <li>
                an NHS number (you may be asked for ID but you donâ€™t need to
                show it. If you do have ID it can be used to make sure your name
                is spelled correctly).
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>You will normally register with a GP close to where you live.</p>

            <p>
              If you expect to be in an area for more than 24 hours but less
              than 3 months, you can register with a GP temporarily.
